Hi! I'm Matthew.

I've been an amateur programmer for most of my life, working in other fields such as 
hospitality, wholesale distribution, and brands. Computer knowledge gave my career a considerable
edge over others as I was able to automate time-consuming tasks, use better tracking, 
integrate specific needs with general-use software... the list goes on.

Unfortunately, the 2020/21 UK government lockdowns (accompanied by the complete shutdown of the industry I was in) 
during COVID-19 have left many people without any other option but to look at different career paths.
I've chosen to go into tech, as it is one field that I can adjust to quickly and have a 
deep-rooted interest in.
